May be you ask yourself where is this information come from
how web worked

#The Internet Versus the Web

#Network

#IP address
Every computer and device (modem, router, smartphone, cars, etc.) connected
to the Internet is assigned a unique numeric IP address (IP stands
for Internet Protocol). For example, the computer that hosts oreilly.com
has the IP address 208.201.239.100.

#Domain Name System (DNS)
All those numbers can be dizzying, so
fortunately, the Domain Name System (DNS) was developed to allow us to
refer to that server by its domain name, “oreilly.com”, as well. The numeric
IP address is useful for computer software, while the domain name is more
accessible to humans. Matching the text domain names to their respective
numeric IP addresses is the job of a separate DNS server

#Open Source
Open source software is developed as
a collaborative effort with the intent
to make its source code available
to other programmers for use and
modification. Open source programs
are usually available for free.

#IP 4 or IP 6
The IANA, the organization that assigns IP numbers, handed out its last bundle of IP
addresses on February 3, 2011. That’s right, no more ###.###.###.###-style IPs. That
format of IP address (called IPv4) is able to produce 4.3 billion unique addresses,
which seemed like plenty when the Internet “experiment” was first conceived in 1977.
There was no way the creators could anticipate that one day every phone, television,
and object on store shelves would be clamoring for one.
The solution is a new IP format (IPv6, already in the works) that allows for trillions
and trillions of unique IP numbers, with the slight snag that it is incompatible with
our current IPv4-based network, so IPv6 will operate as a sort of parallel Internet to
the one we have today. Eventually, IPv4 will be phased out, but some say it will take
decades.


#Protocal
These standardized methods for
transferring data or documents over a network


#Internet
 is a network of connected computers. The purpose of connecting computers together, of course, is to share
information. There are many ways information can be passed between
computers, including email, file transfer (FTP), and many more specialized
modes upon which the Internet is built. These standardized methods for
transferring data or documents over a network are known as protocols
 
#web
The Web is a subset of the Internet. It is just one of many ways information can be transferred overnetworked computers

The Web (originally called the World Wide Web, thus the “www” in
site addresses) is just one of the ways information can be shared over the
Internet. It is unique in that it allows documents to be linked to one another
using hypertext links—thus forming a huge “web” of connected information.
The Web uses a protocol called HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol).
That acronym should look familiar because it is the first four letters of nearly
all website addresses, as we’ll discuss in an upcoming section

# HTML
What is HTML
HTML markup language for creating Web pages

A basic HTML document looks like this:



<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Sample page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Sample page</h1>
    <p>This is a <a href="demo.html">simple</a> sample.</p>
    <!-- this is a comment -->
  </body>
</html>
